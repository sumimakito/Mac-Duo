# Mac Duo

**Wish you could bring the iPhone Duo effect to your MacBook?**

Close the lid and watch your screen content tilt, blur, and fade as it moves.  
Mac Duo adds this effect to your MacBook, with controls in the menu bar.

With the default settings, it's recommended to view the effect in front of your MacBook.

- **Metal rendering:** Uses GPU rendering to apply perspective, blur, and dimming as the lid closes.
- **Live screen content:** Uses ScreenCaptureKit to capture and render screen content in real time.
- **Adjustable perspective:** Tweak the perspective to suit your viewing position and make the effect look more natural.

## Download

[Download DMG](https://github.com/sumimakito/Mac-Duo/releases/download/dev/Mac-Duo-dev.dmg) | [Download ZIP](https://github.com/sumimakito/Mac-Duo/releases/download/dev/Mac-Duo-dev.zip)

These downloads contain the latest [development build](https://github.com/sumimakito/Mac-Duo/releases/tag/dev) for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

Requires macOS 14 or later and a MacBook with a compatible lid angle sensor.
Grant Screen Recording permission when prompted to enable the effect.

## Build

Requires Xcode with Swift 6.0 or later. Run from the project directory:

```sh
./build.sh
```

The script creates `build/Mac Duo.app` with an ad-hoc signature. Open it from Finder, or build and launch with:

```sh
./build.sh --run
```

macOS may require Screen Recording permission again after rebuilding with ad-hoc signing.

## Known limitations

- Only MacBooks with a compatible lid angle sensor can use the effect. The app reports when no sensor is available.
- The effect applies only to the built-in display.
- The effect stops when macOS sleeps as the lid closes.
- Clicks pass through the effect to the apps underneath.
